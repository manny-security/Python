# 🐍 Python Practice Projects

This repository is a collection of **Python practice problems** I worked on to improve my programming skills and prepare for technical interviews.  

Each file is a standalone script that tackles a different coding challenge — covering topics like **algorithms, data structures, file handling, string manipulation, and problem-solving**.

- Working with dictionaries and sets  
- String and list manipulation  
- File I/O operations  
- Writing reusable functions  
- Thinking in terms of **problem-solving and algorithms**
